          <p class="feedback-text">"I had the pleasure of leading Natália for two years and I can say that she is a competent and dedicated professional. Her Figma skills and attention to detail contributed significantly to our projects. Natália has always shown herself to be agile, organized and proactive, ready to help with questions from developers and less experienced colleagues and is always looking to update herself. She has a collaborative approach that helps maintain a good working environment and always tries to balance the needs of the clients with the constraints of the project. She is a reliable and efficient professional and an excellent addition to any design team."</p>
