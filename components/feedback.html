              our projects. Natália has always shown herself to be agile, organized and proactive, ready to help with
              questions from developers and less experienced colleagues and is always looking to update herself. She has a
              collaborative approach that helps maintain a good working environment and always tries to balance the needs
              of the clients with the constraints of the project. She is a reliable and efficient professional and an
